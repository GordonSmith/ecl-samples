The EDGAR Example project shows how to process SEC EDGAR filings in ECL.

The files (one filing per file) should have been sprayed as a BLOB (see
Programmers Guide for an example).  This can be done with a variable length
record spray specifying NO SPLIT and a Prefix of filename,filesize


The Raw_Input_Files module with give you a file of XBRL files or a file of
Classic EDGAR filings

The XBRL_Extract module provides a file of extracted revenue and net income
data.  The extraction is extended to other interesting values by adding in
additional path expressions

The ClassicEDGAR_Extract defines how revenue and net income information is
extracted from the text filing tables.  It can be extended by adding
grammatical productions

In both cases, there are definitions for the extraction of the filing type,
the company name, and other interesting information about the filing.
