I have placed Machine Learning (ML) example programs on github: https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-samples. They are in the folder MLUsageExamples.

These are small example ECL programs that illustrate how to use the functions and macros in the Machine Learning (ML) library. Each of these examples are stand-alone except for the need of ML. To execute any of them, you only need the ML library in your repository.

There are more than 200 example programs. Furthermore, the number of example programs will increase over time. I will post again when I add additional programs.

In MLUsageExamples, there is a README.txt file that tells a little about the organization of these example programs.

ORGANIZATION

MLUsageExamples is organized like the ML library's folder structure. For example an example of how to use ML.Mat.Add will be found in the Mat folder because ML.Mat.Add.ecl is in the ML/Mat folder of the ML library. Furthermore, modules of the ML library will have  examples in a folder named after the module. For example, examples of how to use the functions of the ML.Mat.Each.ecl module will be found in the folder MLUsageExamples/Mat/Each.
